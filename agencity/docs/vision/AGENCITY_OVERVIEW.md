## Problem

**The best candidates aren't searchable.**

Early-stage founders spend 40% of their time on hiring. Most of that time is wasted because:

1. **You don't know what you need.** "I need a prompt engineer" is not a spec. The role changes as the product changes.

2. **The best people are invisible.** A brilliant CS junior at UCSD doesn't have a polished LinkedIn. They're in a club, have a sparse GitHub, and aren't "open to work."

3. **You can't sustain sourcing.** A week of focus gets you leads. Then you go heads-down and the pipeline dies.

4. **Traditional search fails.** LinkedIn finds people with optimized profiles. You need people who *could be great*—not people who look great on paper.

5. **Every miss is expensive.** In a 10-person company, one wrong hire isn't "a miss"—it's months of drag.

## Solution

**Agencity finds the people you can't search for.**

Tell us what you need—even if it's vague. We'll ask smart follow-up questions to understand what you actually mean, search deeper than LinkedIn to find hidden candidates, and tell you honestly what we know vs. what you'll need to verify yourself.

We're not evaluating if someone *is* great. We're finding people **worth a 30-minute conversation**.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Tell us what you need

Start vague: *"I need a prompt engineer for my startup."*

We ask smart follow-up questions:
- What does your startup do?
- What will this person actually be building?
- What would success look like by day 60?
- Any past hires that worked well—or didn't?
- Location or school preferences?

We keep asking until we have enough context to search effectively.

### 2. We search deep

Not just LinkedIn. We look where others don't:

| Source | What we find |
|--------|--------------|
| Our network (6,000+) | Opted-in candidates |
| University clubs | AI clubs, engineering orgs, incubators |
| GitHub activity | Projects, commits, contributions |
| Hackathons | Participants, winners, project builders |
| Course signals | Who took relevant classes |
| Referral network | "Who do you know who's good at X?" |

### 3. We tell you honestly what we know

No fake match scores. For each candidate, we show:

**Known Facts** (verifiable)
- School, year, major
- Club memberships
- Courses taken

**Observed Signals** (what we saw)
- GitHub projects and activity
- Hackathon participation
- Public work

**Unknown** (what you'll need to verify)
- Actual skill level
- Work style and speed
- Interest in your startup

**Why Consider**
- Connection to what you described
- Why this person might be a fit

**Suggested Next Step**
- What to ask in the first conversation

### 4. You decide who to talk to

We surface candidates worth a conversation. You make the call.

Your feedback improves future results—what you liked, what you passed on, and why.

## Who It's For

- Seed to Series A founders
- Hiring 1-10 roles this year
- No dedicated recruiter
- Roles are evolving and cross-functional
- Need speed over process

---

## The Honest Approach

**We don't say:**
- "92% match score"
- "Strong prompt engineering skills"
- "Great culture fit"
- Anything we can't verify

**We do say:**
- "Has 2 LLM projects on GitHub"
- "Won hackathon with chatbot project"
- "Skill level unknown—ask about X"
- Facts, signals, and honest unknowns

---

## Summary

**Problem:** The best candidates aren't searchable. Traditional tools find people with optimized profiles, not hidden talent.

**Solution:** Tell us what you need. We search deep, find people others miss, and tell you honestly what we know vs. don't know.

**Output:** Candidates worth a 30-minute conversation—with clear next steps for what to verify.
